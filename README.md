# Ping Pong Hand Gesture Game

This repository contains a gesture-controlled Ping Pong game built using Python and OpenCV. The game uses real-time hand tracking to control the paddle, offering an interactive and intuitive gaming experience.

---

## Features

- **Gesture Control**: Use hand movements to control the ping pong paddle.
- **Real-Time Tracking**: Implements computer vision techniques for smooth and responsive gameplay.
- **Customizable Gameplay**: Adjust parameters like paddle sensitivity and speed for personalized gameplay.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Python**: Core programming language for development.
- **OpenCV**: For real-time hand detection and tracking.
- **NumPy**: Used for efficient numerical computations.

---

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- OpenCV library installed (`pip install opencv-python`)
- Webcam for real-time tracking

---

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ping-pong-gesture.git
   cd ping-pong-gesture
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # For macOS/Linux
   # OR
   .venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the game:
   ```bash
   python game.py
   ```

## Files and Structure

| File         | Purpose                                 |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `game.py`    | Main script to run the Ping Pong game. |
| `handtrack.py` | Module for hand detection and tracking.|
| `utils.py`   | Utility functions for game mechanics.   |

---

## How It Works

1. **Hand Detection**: Uses OpenCV to detect the player's hand via webcam input.
2. **Motion Tracking**: Tracks hand movement and maps it to the paddle's position.
3. **Gameplay**: Reflects the ball using the paddle controlled by hand gestures.

---

## Customization

- Modify `game.py` to adjust game parameters like ball speed, paddle size, and screen resolution.
- Update `handtrack.py` to tweak hand detection sensitivity.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Webcam Not Detected**: Ensure your webcam is connected and accessible.
- **Performance Issues**: Lower the frame resolution in `game.py` to improve performance on slower systems.
- **Hand Tracking Not Working**: Check the lighting and adjust thresholds in `handtrack.py`.
